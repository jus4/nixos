# NixOs configuration
Still under major development but my basic setup for Nixos. Include home.nix for homemanger configuration and basic development tools.

## Desktop
- Xmonad
- Polybar
- Rofi
- dMenu
- Tmux

## Editing
- NixVim
- Hydrogen ( not really used )
- eMacs for notes ( setup incomplete )

## System
- NixLd for installing packages for node projects. The only sane way for project development that require building packages.
- Strongswan config is included in the config but not in this repo. Remove the line from configuration.nix if you want install the setup.

## Install
Remove the Strongswan from configuration.nix file in order to install because file no included in the repo. TODO included it in a private repo
